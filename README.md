Hi Everyone,

This project is a work of graph in python.

Last step : Removed steps to remove individual edges from the on_click_stop function.
The Function, The graphic was completely cleared with ax.clear() and then redrawn to its original state.
Calling drawn_edges.clear(), additional path drawings, etc. preserved to reset references as well.
